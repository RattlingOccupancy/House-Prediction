# üè† House Price Prediction Using XGBoost

This project will be a prediction of housing price based on the Boston Housing Dataset taken as an implementation of a regression model. The process is carried out by data pre-processing, correlation analysis of features, training of models and testing them. Gradient boosting model (XGBoost) performance in structured data tasks was powerful and this is the reason as to why it was used.

As a result of such implementation, it was seen how a significant ML concept like that of regression modeling, train-test splitting, performance metrics, and the model evaluation using R and MAE work.

## üìà Algorithm Used

- **XGBoost Regressor (XGBRegressor)**
  -   A gradient-boosted decision tree algorithm ideal to run structured regression tasks; it performs highly.
